			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

			<p>My name is Emily Turner-Sherwood and I was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I've lived in quite a few places in my life...Ottawa, Norwich, London and Madison...I moved to Chicago approximately a year ago with my husband and my dog, Zeus, and it has been amazing so far! Coming from Canada, I am a big hockey fan (Go Canucks Go!), huge Tim Horton's lover and truly believe that the Beaver is a strong and noble creature. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Chicago had been great for me. I have a full-time job downtown that's pretty flexible and relaxed which gives me the time to practice coding, a new skill I've been trying to learn recently. With a MA in Film Studies, I like to watch movies (obviously) in my spare time as well as watch the sunrise with my dog.</p>
